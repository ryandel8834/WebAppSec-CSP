  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  This document defines a number of Content Security Policy directives which
  allow developers to lock down properties of the environment in which a policy
  applies.

  <h2 id="directives">Directives</h2>

  <h3 id="directives-features">Feature Directives</h3>

  <h4 id="directive-base-uri">`base-uri`</h4>

  The <dfn>base-uri</dfn> directive restricts the {{URL}}s which can be used in
  a {{Document}}'s <{base}> element. The syntax for the directive's name and
  value is described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "base-uri"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  The following algorithm is called during HTML's <a>set the frozen base url</a>
  algorithm in order to monitor and enforce this directive:

  <h5 id="allow-base-for-document" algorithm>
    Is |base| allowed for |document|?
  </h5>

  Given a {{URL}} (|base|), and a {{Document}} (|document|), this algorithm
  returns "`Allowed`" if |base| may be used as the value of a <{base}>
  element's <{base/href}> attribute, and "`Blocked`" otherwise:

  1.  For each |policy| in |document|'s <a>global object</a>'s
      <a for="global object">csp list</a>:

      1.  Let |source list| be `null`.

      2.  If a <a>directive</a> whose <a for="directive">name</a> is
          "`base-uri`" is present in |policy|'s <a for="policy">directive
          set</a>, set |source list| to that <a>directive</a>'s
          <a for="directive">value</a>.

      3.  If |source list| is `null`, skip to the next |policy|.

      4.  If the result of executing [[#match-url-to-source-list]] on |base| and
          |source list| is "`Does Not Match`":
         
          1.  Let |violation| be the result of executing
              [[#create-violation-for-global]] on |document|'s <a>global
              object</a>, |policy|, and "<a>`base-uri`</a>".

          2.  Set |violation|'s <a for="violation">resource</a> to "`inline`".

          3.  Execute [[#report-violation]] on |violation|.
          
          4.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is "`enforce`",
              return "`Blocked`".

  2.  Return "`Allowed`".

  <h4 id="directive-plugin-types">`plugin-types`</h4>

  <dfn>plugin-types</dfn>

  <h4 id="directive-sandbox">`sandbox`</h4>

  The <dfn>sandbox</dfn> directive specifies an HTML sandbox policy which the
  user agent will apply to a resource, just as though it had been included in
  an <{iframe}> with a <{iframe/sandbox}> property.

  The directive's syntax is described by the following ABNF grammar:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    directive-name  = "sandbox"
    directive-value = "" / <a>token</a> *( <a>RWS</a> <a>token</a> )
  </pre>

  This directive has no reporting requirements; it will be ignored entirely when
  delivered in a <a>`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`</a> header, or within
  a <{meta}> element.

  <h5 id="directive-sandbox-apply" algorithm>
    Apply the `sandbox` directive to |document|
  </h5>

  Given a |document|, this algorithm adjusts its <a>forced sandboxing flag
  set</a> according to the <a>`sandbox`</a> values present in its policies.

  Note: This algorithm is executed during [[#initialise-global-object-csp]]
  (which is executed during HTML's <a>initialising a new `Document` object</a>
  algorithm).

  1.  For each |policy| in |document|'s <a>global object</a>'s
      <a for="global object">CSP list</a>:

      1.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is not "`Enforce`", skip
          to the next |policy|.

      2.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> does not contain a
          <a>directive</a> (|directive|) whose <a for="directive">name</a> is
          "`sandbox`", skip to the next |policy|.

      3.  <a>Parse a sandboxing directive</a> using |directive|'s
          <a for="directive">value</a> as the input, and |document|'s <a>forced
          sandboxing flag set</a> as the output.

  <h3 id="directives-navigation">Navigation Directives</h3>

  <h4 id="directive-form-action">`form-action`</h4>

  The <dfn>form-action</dfn> directive restricts the {{URL}}s which can be used
  as the target of a form submissions.

  ISSUE: Define the hooks into HTML's navigation and form submission algorithms.

  <h4 id="directive-frame-ancestors">`frame-ancestors`</h4>

  The <dfn>frame-ancestors</dfn> directive restricts the {{URL}}s which can
  embed the resource using <{frame}>, <{iframe}>, <{object}>, <{embed}>, or
  <{applet}> element. Resources can use this directive to avoid many UI
  Redressing [[UISECURITY]] attacks, by avoiding the risk of being embedded into
  potentially hostile contexts.

  The directive's syntax is described by the following ABNF grammar:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    directive-name  = "frame-ancestors"
    directive-value = <a>ancestor-source-list</a>

    <dfn>ancestor-source-list</dfn> = ( <a>ancestor-source</a> *( <a>RWS</a> <a>ancestor-source</a>) ) / "<a>'none'</a>"
    <dfn>ancestor-source</dfn>      = <a>scheme-source</a> / <a>host-source</a> / "<a>'self'</a>"
  </pre>

  The `frame-ancestors` directive is enforced as part of
  [[#should-block-response]].

  The `frame-ancestors` directive MUST be ignored when contained in a policy
  declared via a <{meta}> element.

  Note: The `frame-ancestors` directive's syntax is similar to a <a>source
  list</a>, but `frame-ancestors` will not fall back to the `default-src`
  directive's value if one is specified. That is, a policy that declares
  `default-src 'none'` will still allow the resource to be embedded by anyone.

  <h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

  <h3 id="html-integration">Integration with HTML</h3>
  
  1.  [[#allow-base-for-document]] is called during <{base}>'s <a>set the frozen
      base URL</a> algorithm to ensure that the <{base/href}> attribute's value
      is valid.

      ISSUE: Need to add this to HTML.

  The <a>`frame-ancestors`</a> directive allows a resource to gain knowlege of
  its ancestors' origins through brute force.
