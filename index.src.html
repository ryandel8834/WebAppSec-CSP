  [INTRODUCTION GOES HERE]

  ISSUE: CSP3 is a work in progress, and isn't quite yet ready for anyone to
  look at seriously. If you have suggestions, please
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/new">file a bug</a>!
  Otherwise, you'll probably want to look at the stable document at
  <a href="http://w3.org/TR/CSP2/">http://w3.org/TR/CSP2/</a>.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-basic">Control Execution</h4>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc's developers want to protect themselves against cross-site
    scripting attacks. They can mitigate the risk of script injection by
    ensuring that their trusted CDN is the only origin from which script can
    load and execute. Moreover, they wish to ensure that no plugins can
    execute in their pages' contexts. The following policy has that effect:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://cdn.example.com/scripts/; object-src 'none'
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  Content Security Policy aims to do to a few related things:

  1.  Mitigate the risk of content-injection attacks by giving developers
      fairly granular control over

      *   The resources which can be requested (and subsequently embedded or
          executed) on behalf of a specific {{Document}} or {{Worker}}

      *   The execution of inline script

      *   Dynamic code execution (via {{eval()}} and similar constructs)

      *   The application of inline style

  2.  Mitigate the risk of attacks which require a resource to be embedded
      in a malicious context ("Pixel Perfect", etc) by giving developers
      granular control over the origins which can embed a given resource.

  3.  Provide a policy framework which allows developers to tweak
      security-relevant settings.

  4.  Provide a reporting mechanism which allows developers to detect flaws
      being exploited in the wild.

  <h3 id="changes-from-level-2">Changes from Level 2</h3>

  This document describes an evolution of the Content Security Policy Level 2
  specification [[CSP2]]. The following is a high-level overview of the changes:

  1.  The specification has been rewritten from the ground up in terms of the
      [[FETCH]] specification, which should make it simpler to integrate CSP's
      requirements and restrictions with other specifications (and with
      Service Workers in particular).

  2.  The `frame-src` directive, which was deprecated in CSP Level
      2, has been removed.

<!-- Big Text: Framework -->
<section>
  <h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

  <h3 id="framework-policy">Policies</h3>

  A <dfn local-lt="policies">policy</dfn> defines a set of allowed and
  restricted behaviors, and may be applied to a {{Window}} or
  {{WorkerGlobalScope}} as described in [[#apply-to-global-object]].
  
  Each policy has an associated <dfn for="policy">directive set</dfn>, which
  is a set of <a>directives</a> that define the policy's implications when
  applied.

  A <dfn>serialized policy</dfn> is an ASCII string, consisting of a
  semicolon-delimited series of <a>serialized directives</a>, adhering to the
  following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:
 
  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    <dfn>serialized-policy</dfn> = <a>serialized-directive</a> *( <a>OWS</a> ";" [ <a>OWS</a> <a>serialized-directive</a> ] )
                        ; <a>OWS</a> is defined in section 3.2.3 of RFC 7230
  </pre>

  To <dfn>parse a serialized policy</dfn> (<var>policy</var>), execute the
  [[#parse-serialized-policy]] algorithm on <var>policy</var>.

  <h3 id="framework-directives">Directives</h3>

  <a>Policies</a> contain a set of <dfn>directives</dfn>, each of which controls
  a specific behavior. The directives defined in this document are described in
  detail in [[#csp-directives]].

  Each <a>directive</a> is a <dfn for="directive">name</dfn> /
  <dfn for="directive">value</dfn> pair. The <a>name</a> is a non-empty string,
  and the <a>value</a> is a set of non-empty strings. The <a>value</a> set MAY
  be empty.

  A <dfn>serialized directive</dfn> is an ASCII string, consisting of one or more
  whitespace-delimited tokens, and adhering to the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    <dfn>serialized-directive</dfn> = <a>directive-name</a> [ <a>RWS</a> <a>directive-value</a> ]
    <dfn>directive-name</dfn>       = 1*( <a>ALPHA</a> / <a>DIGIT</a> / "-" )
    <dfn>directive-value</dfn>      = *( %x09 / %x20-%x2B / %x2D-%x3A / %x3C-%7E )
                           ; Directive values may contain whitespace and <a>VCHAR</a> characters,
                           ; excluding ";" and ","

    ; <a>RWS</a> is defined in section 3.2.3 of RFC7230. <a>ALPHA</a>, <a>DIGIT</a>, and
    ; <a>VCHAR</a> are defined in Appendix B.1 of RFC 5234.
  </pre>


  <h3 id="framework-directive-source-list">Source Lists</h3>

  Many <a>directives</a>' <a>values</a> consist of <dfn>source lists</dfn>: sets
  of tokens which identify content that can be fetched and potentially embedded
  or executed. These tokens represent one of the following types of <dfn>source
  expression</dfn>:

  1.  Keywords such as <a grammar>`'none'`</a> and
      <a grammar>`'self'`</a> (which match nothing and the current
      URL's origin, respectively)

  2.  Serialized URLs such as `https://example.com/path/to/file.js`
      (which matches a specific file) or `https://example.com/`
      (which matches everything on that origin)

  3.  Schemes such as `https:` (which matches any resource having
      the specified scheme)

  4.  Hosts such as `example.com` (which matches any resource on
      the host, regardless of scheme) or `*.example.com` (which
      matches any resource on the host or any of its subdomains (and any of
      its subdomains' subdomains, and so on))

  5.  Nonces such as `'nonce-qwertyu12345'` (which can match specific
      elements on a page)

  6.  Digests such as `'sha256-abcd...'` (which can match specific
      elements on a page)

  A <dfn>serialized source list</dfn> is an ASCII string, consisting of a
  space-delimited series of <a>source expressions</a>, adhering to the
  following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    <dfn>serialized-source-list</dfn> = <a>source-expression</a> *( <a>RWS</a> <a>source-expression</a> ) / "<dfn>'none'</dfn>"
    <dfn>source-expression</dfn>      = <a>scheme-source</a> / <a>host-source</a> / <a>keyword-source</a>
                             / <a>nonce-source</a> / <a>hash-source</a>

    ; Schemes:
    <dfn>scheme-source</dfn> = <a>scheme</a> ":"
                    ; <a>scheme</a> is defined in section 3.1 of RFC 3986.

    ; Hosts: "example.com" / "*.example.com" / "https://*.example.com:12/path/to/file.js"
    <dfn>host-source</dfn> = [ <a>scheme-part</a> "://" ] <a>host-part</a> [ <a>port-part</a> ] [ <a>path-part</a> ]
    <dfn>scheme-part</dfn> = <a>scheme</a>
    <dfn>host-part</dfn>   = "*" / [ "*." ] 1*<a>host-char</a> *( "." 1*<a>host-char</a> )
    <dfn>host-char</dfn>   = <a>ALPHA</a> / <a>DIGIT</a> / "-"
    <dfn>port-part</dfn>   = ":" ( 1*<a>DIGIT</a> / "*" )
    <dfn>path-part</dfn>   = <a>path</a>
                  ; <a>path</a> is defined in section 3.3 of RFC 3986.
   
    ; Keywords:
    <dfn>keyword-source</dfn> = "<dfn>'self'</dfn>" / "<dfn>'unsafe-inline'</dfn>" / "<dfn>'unsafe-eval'</dfn>" 

    ; Nonces: 'nonce-[nonce goes here]'
    <dfn>nonce-source</dfn>  = "'nonce-" <a>base64-value</a> "'"
    <dfn>base64-value</dfn>  = 1*( <a>ALPHA</a> / <a>DIGIT</a> / "+" / "/" )*2( "=" ) 

    ; Digests: 'sha256-[digest goes here]'
    <dfn>hash-source</dfn>    = "'" <a>hash-algorithm</a> "-" <a>base64-value</a> "'"
    <dfn>hash-algorithm</dfn> = "sha256" / "sha384" / "sha512"
  </pre>

  The <a grammar>host-char</a> production intentionally contains only ASCII
  characters; internationalized domain names cannot be entered directly as part
  of a <a>serialized policy</a>, but instead MUST be Punycode-encoded
  [[!RFC3492]]. For example, the domain `üüüüüü.de` MUST be represented as
  `xn--tdaaaaaa.de`.

  Note: Though IP address do match the grammar above, only
  `127.0.0.1` will actually match a URL when used in a source
  expression (see [[#match-url-to-source-list]] for details). The security
  properties of IP addresses are suspect, and authors ought to prefer hostnames
  whenever possible.

  To <dfn>parse a serialized source list</dfn> (<var>serialized source
  list</var>), execute the [[#parse-serialized-source-list]] algorithm on
  <var>serialized source list</var>.

  A {{URL}} <dfn>matches a source list</var> if the algorithm in
  [[#match-url-to-source-list]] returns `Matches`.

<!-- Big Text: Delivery -->
<section>
  <h2 id="policy-delivery">
    Policy Delivery
  </h2>

  This document defines four delivery mechanisms for a resource's policy:

  1.  An HTTP response header (defined in [[#csp-header]] and [[#cspro-header]])
      which declares a policy as a string and applies it to the resource which
      which the header is delivered. The policy syntax is defined in
      [[#framework-policy]].

  2.  A <{meta}> element (defined in [[#meta-element]]), which declares a policy
      as a string and applies it to the resource in which the <{meta}> element
      is embedded. The policy syntax is defined in [[#framework-policy]].

  <h3 id="delivery-declarative">
    Declarative Delivery
  </h3>

  <h4 id="csp-header">
    The `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP Response Header Field
  </h4>

  The <dfn>`Content-Security-Policy`</dfn> HTTP response header field
  is the preferred mechanism for delivering a policy from a server to a client.
  The header's value is represented by the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Content-Security-Policy = 1#<a grammar>serialized-policy</a>
  </pre>

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src 'self';
                               reports /csp-reporting-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  A server MAY send different `Content-Security-Policy` header field
  values with different <a>representations</a> of the same resource.

  A server SHOULD NOT send more than one HTTP response header field named
  "`Content-Security-Policy`" with a given <a>resource
  representation</a>. The user agent MUST <a>enforce</a> each of the policies
  contained in each such header field as described in
  [[#algorithms-application]].

  <h4 id="cspro-header">
    The `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` HTTP Response Header Field
  </h4>

  The <dfn>`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`</dfn> HTTP response
  header field allows web developers to experiment with policies by monitoring
  (but not enforcing) their effects. The header's value is represented by the
  following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only = 1#<a grammar>serialized-policy</a>
  </pre>

  This header field allows developers to piece together their security policy in
  an iterative fashion, deploying a report-only policy based on their best
  estimate of how their site behaves, watching for violation reports, and then
  moving to an enforced policy once they've gained confidence in that behavior.

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>: script-src 'self';
                                           reports /csp-reporting-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  A server MAY send different `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`
  header field values with different <a>representations</a> of the same
  resource.

  A server SHOULD NOT send more than one HTTP response header field named
  "`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`" with a given <a>resource
  representation</a>. The user agent MUST <a>monitor</a> each of the policies
  contained in each such header field as described in
  [[#algorithms-application]].

  Note: The `<a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>` header is
  <strong>not</strong> supported inside a <{meta}> element.

  <h4 id="meta-element">
    The `<meta>` element
  </h4>

  A {{Document}} may deliver a policy via one or more HTML <{meta}> elements
  whose <{meta/http-equiv}> attributes are an <a>ASCII case-insensitive
  match</a> for the string "`Content-Security-Policy`". For example:

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self'"&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  Implementation details can be found in [[#apply-via-meta]].

  Authors are <em>strongly encouraged</em> to place <{meta}> elements as early
  in the document as possible, because policies in <{meta}> elements are not
  applied to content which precedes them. In particular, note that resources
  fetched or prefetched using the `Link` HTTP response header
  field, and resources fetched or prefetched using <{link}> and <{script}>
  elements which precede a <{meta}>-delivered policy will not be blocked.

  Note: A policy specified via a <{meta}> element will be enforced along with
  any other policies active for the protected resource, regardless
  of where they're specified. The general impact of enforcing multiple
  policies is described in [[#multiple-policies]].

  Note: Modifications to the <{meta/content}> attribute of a <{meta}> element
  after the element has been parsed will be ignored.

  Note: The `<a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>`
  header is <em>not</em> supported inside a <{meta}> element.

  <h3 id="delivery-implicit">
    Implicit Delivery 
  </h3>

  Resources with <a>local schemes</a> (e.g. `about`,
  `blob:`, `data:`, and `filesystem:`), as well
  as resouces embedded via <{iframe}>'s <{iframe/srcdoc}> attribute, are
  considered same-origin with the origin that created them, but have no
  mechanism for header-based policy delivery. To ensure that this property
  doesn't allow a trivial bypass of a page's policy (by creating a
  `blob:` and embedding it in an <{iframe}>, for instance), these
  kinds of resources inherit the policy of their embedding context, as described
  in [[#apply-to-document]], [[#apply-to-worker]], and
  [[#apply-to-srcdoc-document]].

  ISSUE(w3c/webappsec#451): We should consider extending this to include
  auxiliary browsing contexts, not just nested browsing contexts.

  ISSUE: Move this to a monkey patch of the relevant algorithms in HTML.

  <h2 id="csp-directives">
    Content Security Policy Directives
  </h2>
  
  This specification defines a number of types of <a>directives</a> which allow
  developers to control certain aspects of their sites' behavior. The defined
  directives fall into one of several categories:

  1.  <dfn>Request Directives</dfn> control the locations from which certain
      resource types may be loaded. For instance, <a>script-src</a> allows
      developers to whitelist trusted sources of script to execute on a page,
      while <a>font-src</a> controls the sources of web fonts.

  2.  ...

  To mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting attacks, web developers SHOULD
  include directives that regulate sources of script and plugins. They can do
  so by including:

  *   Both the <a>script-src</a> and <a>object-src</a> directives, or
  *   a <a>default-src</a> directive

  In either case, developers SHOULD NOT include either
  <a grammar>`'unsafe-inline'`</a>, or `data:` as valid
  sources in their policies. Both enable XSS attacks by allowing code to be
  included directly in the document itself; they are best avoided completely.

  <h3 id="directives-request">

  <h4 id="directive-child-src">`child-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>child-src</dfn> directive governs the creation of <a>nested browsing
  contexts</a> and Worker execution contexts. The syntax for the directive's
  name and value is described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "child-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>

  <h3 id="algorithms-fetch">Fetch Interface</h3>

  This specification provides two algorithms which allow Fetch to make decisions
  about whether or not a particular <a>request</a> should be blocked based on
  its {{Request/client}}'s Content Security Policy [[!FETCH]]. The policy check
  occurs twice: once at the top of Fetch, ensuring that outgoing requests
  satisfy the relevant policy; and once at the bottom, ensuring that incoming
  responses match as well (as they could have been modified in interesting ways
  by an intermediate Service Worker). These algorithms can be considered the
  public interface to the Content Security Policy specification:

  <h4 id="should-block-request">
    Should <var>request</var> be blocked by Content Security Policy?
  </h4>

  Given a <a>request</a> (<var>request</var>), this algorithm returns
  `Blocked` or `Allowed` based on <var>request</var>'s
  {{Request/client}}'s Content Security Policy.

  Note: [[FETCH]] calls this algorithm as step #3 of its <a>Main Fetch</a>
  algorithm.

  1.  Let <var>client</var> be <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}.

  2.  Return `Blocked`.

  ISSUE: We should probably expand on this definition a bit.

  <h4 id="should-block-response">
    Should <var>response</var> to <var>request</var> be blocked by Content
    Security Policy?
  </h4>

  Given a <a>response</a> (<var>response</var>) and a <a>request</a>
  (<var>request</var>), this algorithm returns `Blocked` or
  `Allowed` based on <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}'s
  Content Security Policy.

  Note: [[FETCH]] calls this algorithm as step #12 of its <a>Main Fetch</a>
  algorithm.

  1.  Let <var>client</var> be <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}.

  2.  Return `Blocked`.

  ISSUE: Monkey patches gonna monkey patch. Talk to WHATWG / WICG.

  Each of the delivery mechanisms specified in [[#policy-delivery]] can be used
  to add values to one of three properties this specification adds to
  <a>environment settings objects</a> to store the relevant policy data for a
  resource:

  : <dfn export for="environment settings object">
      enforced Content Security Policies

  :: A set of <a>policies</a> which are to be enforced for the settings object.
     This property's value is the empty set unless otherwise specified.

    </dfn>
  :: A list of <a>policies</a> which are to be monitored for the settings
     object. This property's value is the empty list unless otherwise specified.
  : <dfn export for="environment settings object">
      inherits Content Security Policies
    </dfn>
  :: A boolean value signifying whether or not the policies of an <a>embedding
     `Document`</a> ought to be applied (as described in
     [[#get-policies]]). This property is `false` unless otherwise
     specified.

  A <a>policy</a> is <dfn export local-lt="enforcing">enforced</dfn> for an
  <a>environment settings object</a> by inserting it into the object's
  <a>enforced Content Security Policies</a> list. A string is <a>enforced</a>
  by <a>enforcing</a> each result of executing [[#parse-serialized-policy]] on
  the string.

  A <a>policy</a> is <dfn export local-lt="monitoring">monitored</dfn> for an

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="security-nonces">Nonce Reuse</h3>

  Nonces override the other restrictions present in the directive in which
  they're delivered. It is critical, then, that they remain unguessable, as
  bypassing a resource's policy is otherwise trivial.

  If a server delivers a <a grammar>nonce-source</a> expression as part of a
  <a>policy</a>, the server MUST generate a unique value each time it
  transmits a policy. The generated value SHOULD be at least 128 bits long
  (before encoding), and SHOULD be generated via a cryptographically secure
  random number generator in order to ensure that the value is difficult for
  an attacker to predict.

  Note: Using a nonce to whitelist inline script or style is less secure than
  not using a nonce, as nonces override the restrictions in the directive in
  which they are present. An attacker who can gain access to the nonce can
  execute whatever script they like, whenever they like. That said, nonces
  provide a substantial improvement over <a grammar>'unsafe-inline'</a> when
  layering a content security policy on top of old code. When considering
  <a grammar>'unsafe-inline'</a>, authors are encouraged to consider nonces
  (or hashes) instead.

  <h3 id="multiple-policies">
    The effect of multiple policies
  </h3>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  The above sections note that when multiple policies are present, each must be
  enforced or reported, according to its type. An example will help clarify how
  that ought to work in practice. The behavior of an `XMLHttpRequest`
  might seem unclear given a site that, for whatever reason, delivered the
  following HTTP headers:

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' http://example.com http://example.net;
                               connect-src 'none';
      Content-Security-Policy: connect-src http://example.com/;
                               script-src http://example.com/
    </pre>
  </div>

  Is a connection to example.com allowed or not? The short answer is that the
  connection is not allowed. Enforcing both policies means that a potential
  connection would have to pass through both unscathed. Even though the second
  policy would allow this connection, the first policy contains
  `connect-src 'none'`, so its enforcement blocks the connection. The
  impact is that adding additional policies to the list of policies to enforce
  can <em>only</em> further restrict the capabilities of the protected resource.

  To demonstrate that further, consider a script tag on this page. The first
  policy would lock scripts down to `'self'`, `http://example.com` and
  `http://example.net` via the `default-src` directive. The second, however,
  would only allow script from `http://example.com/`. Script will only load if
  it meets both policy’s criteria: in this case, the only origin that can match
  is `http://example.com`, as both policies allow it.
