  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Content Security Policy is a great defense against cross-site scripting
  attacks, allowing developers to harden their own sites against injection of
  malicious script, style, and other resource types. It does not, however,
  give developers the ability to apply restrictions to third-party content
  loaded in via `<iframe>`. Allowing CSP to apply directly to these third-party
  contexts would be dangerous; CSP gives quite granular control over resource
  loading, and it's very possible to introduce vulnerabilities into an otherwise
  secure page by denying it access to particular scripts. We've seen these kinds
  of issues in past features such as `X-XSS-Protection`, so we must be careful
  to avoid reintroducing them in a new form.

  That said, it would be quite useful to be able to place restrictions upon
  widgets, advertisements, and other kinds of third-party content. This document
  proposes a mechanism which relies on an explicit opt-in from the embedded
  content, which ought to make it possible for widgets to cooperate with their
  embedders to negotiate a reasonable set of restrictions.

  In short, the embedder proposes a Content Security Policy as an attribute on
  the `<iframe>` element. This policy is transmitted along with the HTTP request
  for the framed content in an `Embedding-CSP` header. If the embedded content
  can accept that policy, it may do so by returning the proposed policy in a
  `Content-Security-Policy` header along with the response.

  If the response contains a policy identical to the policy which the embedder
  requested, the user agent will render the embedded content. If no such policy
  is present, the response will be blocked.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. wishes to ensure that the advertisements that run on its
    various publications are locked down to include script from trusted origins
    that have been audited for safety. They can do so by including the
    advertisement via an <{iframe}> element with a <{iframe/csp}> attribute:

    <pre>
      &lt;iframe src="https://advertisements-r-us.example.com/ad1.cfm"
              <a for="iframe" element-attr>csp</a>="script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/"&gt;
      &lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>

    This will generate a request to `advertisements-r-us.example.com` that has
    an <a>`Embedding-CSP`</a> header, as follows:

    <pre>
      GET / HTTP/1.1
      Host: advertisements-r-us.example.com
      ...
      <a>Embedding-CSP</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/
      ...
    </pre>

    The advertisment will only load if it is delivered with a Content Security
    Policy which exactly matches the <{iframe/csp}> attribute's value. One way
    to do so is to send the requested policy:
   
    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/
    </pre>

    The server might want to futher restrict the document, however. Perhaps it
    wishes to ensure that plugins will not be loaded. It can do so by sending
    another policy with additional restrictions:
   
    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/,
                               object-src 'none'
    </pre>

    The "`,`" in the <a>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header's value splits the
    string into two serialized policies, each of which is enforced.
  </div>

  <h3 id="monkey-patching-html">
    Specifying a Policy Requirement
  </h3>

  ISSUE: Monkey-patching HTML.

  <a>Browsing contexts</a> have an <dfn export>`iframe` security policy</dfn>
  attribute, which is `null` unless otherwise specified.

  <{iframe}> elements have a <dfn element-attr for="iframe">csp</dfn> attribute
  which specifies the policy that an embedded document must agree to enforce
  upon itself.

  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface HTMLIFrameElement {
      attribute DOMString csp;
    };
  </pre>

  {{HTMLIFrameElement}}'s {{HTMLIFrameElement/csp}} IDL attribute
  <a>reflects</a> the value of the element's <{iframe/csp}> content attribute.

  When an <{iframe}> element with a <{iframe/csp}> attribute has its <a>nested
  browsing context</a> created (before the intial `about:blank` {{Document}} is
  created), and when an <{iframe}> element's <{iframe/csp}> attribute is set
  or changed while it has a <a>nested browsing context</a>, the user agent
  must set the <a>nested browsing context</a>'s <a>`iframe` security policy</a>
  to the result of executing the <a>parse a serialized policy</a> algorithm on
  the <{iframe/csp}> attribute's value. 

  During the <a>navigate</a> algorithm, perform the following step after the
  current step 19. At this point, the user agent has fetched a response which it
  is about to begin parsing, and redirects have been processed:

  <ol start="20">
    <li>
      If the algorithm in [[#may-load-response]] returns `Blocked` when executed
      upon the resource and the <a>browsing context</a> being navigated, abort
      these steps. The user agent MAY indicate to the user that navigation has
      been aborted for security reasons.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="embedding-csp-http-header">
    The `Embedding-CSP` HTTP Request Header
  </h3>

  In order to ensure that the embedded resource can decide whether or not it is
  willing to adhere to the embedder's requirements, the policy expressed in an
  <{iframe}>'s <{iframe/csp}> attribute is communicated along with some
  <a>requests</a> via an "<dfn export>`Embedding-CSP`</dfn>" HTTP request
  header. The header's value is represented by the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Embedding-CSP = <a grammar>serialized-policy</a>
  </pre>

  A user agent MUST NOT send more than one HTTP response header field named
  "`Embedding-CSP`", and any such header MUST NOT contain more than one
  <a grammar>serialized-policy</a>.

  ISSUE: Step ~15 of the <a>navigate</a> algorithm needs to be adjusted to add
  an `Embedding-CSP` header to a navigational request iff the navigation targets
  a nested browsing context, and if the <a>browsing context container</a> is an
  <{iframe}> element with a <{iframe/csp}> attribute. This should be pretty
  straightforward once the algorithm is rewritten in terms of Fetch, but is a
  bit tricky today.

  <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

  <h3 id="may-load-response">
    Is |response| blocked by |context|'s `iframe` security policy?
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|) and a <a>browsing context</a>
  (|context|), this algorithm returns `Allowed` or `Blocked` as
  appropriate:

  1.  Let |embedding policy| be the value of |context|'s <a>`iframe`
      security policy</a>.

  2.  Let |policy list| be the value of |response|'s
      <a for="response">CSP list</a>.

  3.  If the [[#subsume-policy]] algorithm returns `Subsumed` when executed
      upon |policy list| and |embedding policy|, return `Allowed`.

  4.  Return `Blocked`.

  <h3 id="subsume-policy">
    Is |policy list| subsumed under |subsuming policy|?
  </h3>

  Given a list of <a>policy</a> objects (|policy list|), this algorithm returns
  `Subsumed` if that list enforces a <a>policy</a> which is an exact match for a
  given <a>policy</a> object (|subsuming policy|). It returns `Not Subsumed`
  otherwise.

  Note: Ideally, we'll someday define a real subsumption algorithm
  which would verify that the policy `default-src 'none'; script-src
  https://example.com` is subsumbed under `default-src *.example.com` (as
  there is no case in which the latter will block a request that the former
  would allow). That calculation turns out to be hard, so the current algorithm
  takes the significantly simpler approach of requiring an exact match.

  Note: This is not an efficient algorithm. Implementers are encouraged to
  implement something a little smarter and faster, with the same behavior.

  1.  If |subsuming policy| is `null`, return `Subsumed`.

  2.  For each |policy| in |policy list|:

      1.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is not
          `Enforce`, set skip to the next |policy|.

      2.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> is not the
          same size as |subsuming policy|'s <a for="policy">directive
          set</a>, skip to the next |policy|.

      3.  For each |directive| in |policy|'s
          <a for="policy">directive set</a>:

          1.  Let |subsuming directive| be the <a>directive</a> in
              |subsuming policy|'s <a for="policy">directive
              set</a> whose <a for="directive">name</a> matches
              |directive|'s <a for="directive">name</a>, or `null`
              if no such <a>directive</a> is present.

          2.  If |subsuming directive| is `null`, skip to the next
              |policy|.

          3.  If |subsuming directive|'s <a for="directive">value</a>
              list is not the same size as |directive|'s
              <a for="directive">value</a> list, skip to the next
              |policy|.

          4.  For each |token| in |directive|'s
              <a for="directive">value</a>:

              1.  If |token| is not present in |subsuming
                  directive|'s <a for="directive">value</a>, skip to the
                  next |policy|.

      4.  Return `Subsumed`.

  3.  Return `Not Subsumed`.

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  Embedded documents should be careful to evaluate the proposed Content Security
  Policy, and not simply to reflect whatever policy an embedder suggests. Doing
  so may enable a clever attacker to selectively disable pieces of a website's
  code which are essential for its own protection.

  In particular, documents which do not expect to be embedded should continue to
  respond to any such request with a Content Security Policy containing an
  appropriate `frame-ancestors` directive.

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  This feature allows an embedder to send information to a third-party endpoint
  via the <a>`Embedding-CSP`</a> HTTP header. This doesn't seem to expose any
  information that couldn't be tunneled in the HTTP request itself (via GET
  parameters, etc), and embedders remain in control over the endpoints to which
  such requests may be made by enforcing a Content Security Policy with an
  appropriate `child-src` directive.
